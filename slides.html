# Smashing Bitcoin for Pain and Losses
## The Bitcoin Threat Model
---

# Today's Grab Bag of Fun

- What threat modeling is and why we should do it

- Why bitcoin matters - the human threat model

- The skeleton of the bitcoin threat model

- A couple fun attacks bitcoin has suffered to date

- A couple recent attacks

- Attacks on the horizon

---


# Everyone is a security design analyst

- Unfortunately almost no one is systematic 

- Bitcoin's first threat model was completed less than 1 year ago

- Every conversation about bitcoin is a threat model brainstorming session 

- Threat modeling has been the most popular way to analyze design level security since the 1950s

- Very commonly done in all large software companies today

???
- Just ask the guys on crypto-twitter. 

- As it nears its 10th anniversary.

- But it lacks the follow up discipline. It's not fashionable in academia or pop culture anymore - no one writes or reads treatises

- It got very popular within the department of energy many decades ago 

- From there it spread out to most companies with anything worth protecting.

---

# Threat Modeling is Systematic Analysis 

- Traps our minds in truth 

- Exposes our oversights 

- Corrects our prejudices

- Reveals surprising and profound truth

- Accelerates learning

- Logic is our most reliable tool to find truth 

???
- This is the most important, but the least titillating slide in the presentation. Pay attention closely now and you can enjoy the mocking of bad guys shortly.

- If bitcoin is a mission to create a global money ALL alt coins are an attack.

- If Bcash is an attack then how can Monero, Grin and Litecoin escape that categorization? 

- If people are enslaved because it is profitable and bitcoin makes it less profitable it could bring about the end of human slavery - human threat model.

- I certainly didn't expect to find the potential end of human slavery.

# Threat Modeling is Systematic Analysis 

- Traps our minds in truth 

- Exposes our oversights 

- Corrects our prejudices

- Reveals surprising and profound truth

- Accelerates learning

- Logic is our most reliable tool to find truth 

???


- But this is typical of systematic thinking - it has strange outcomes. 

- Systematically thinking about the speed of light created lots of shocking truth traps that lead to many startling conclusions.

- People have accused me of being around a while. 

- I actually learned almost everything I know about bitcoin in 6 weeks. 

- Logic is required for all thinking. External data is not. If we can find truth through logic it is easier to correct and easier to prove. 2 + 2 = 4 is self evident. It is true "by definition." Systematic analysis emphasises logical thinking.

# Why Bitcoin is Worth Systematic Work

Human slavery has evolved from chattel slavery but retains the fundamental feature of recurring theft (see A Bugs Life, Directed by John Lasseter). 

Modern forms of human slavery include:

- Socialism

- Taxation

- Prohibition 

- Monopoly

- Legal Tender

Bitcoin has the potential to make them all unprofitable all by itself. 

???

- Now it is possible that it will only eliminate legal tender slavery, but that is more than enough to justify systematic analysis. -

- And I think it will do much more. 

- anyone that is considering investing in bitcoin should start with a threat model.

---
# The bones of the bitcoin threat model

- Bitcoin is a mission to create secure money

- Money is an item used by a group of people that trade together to make trade easier 

- Software Creating, Broadcasting, Confirming, and Observing Transactions

- Humans Operating Nodes and Miners, Investing, Accepting, Coding and Manufacturing Hardware

- Full threat model at jwweatherman.com

???

- Money that can't be easily stolen through inflation, extortion, etc.

- it is one thing otherwise we don't call it money we call it barter. Read Human Action by Mises.

- Bitcoin logically breaks into the software and the people that operate the software so we can look at attacking each.

- And we want to look at the things that each do to keep the system functional and how we could break that.

- I would love to walk through each of the attacks with you but we don't have time so please take a look at the bitcoin threat model at jwweatherman.com even if it is only to review the table of contents.

- Bitcoin threat model is at jwweatherman.com (https://jwweatherman.com/#/bitcoinThreatModel) 

- That said we can hit some fun groups of attacks

# Some Noteworthy Attacks
## And the fools that attempted them


???
---

# Block Size Increase Attacks

- Bitcoin Unlimited

- Bitcoin XT

- Segwit 2x

- Lost time, money and reputation

- All failed


???

- Attackers spent significant time and money and reputation on each of these attacks and they all failed to gain the critical mass of suckers required.

---

# Spam Attacks and Empty Blocks

- 2015 through 2017

- Attackers lost millions in mining fees and block rewards.

- To justify a block size increase 

- Premature optimizations to reduce fees

- Created room for "scaling coins"

- Never had a chance

???

- To justify a block size increase based on the rhetoric and timing.

- Block rewards were smaller to the degree that it reduced the bitcoin price.

- Mining fees were lost because the attackers mined empty blocks, low fee and no fee transactions while ignoring higher fee transactions.

- Mining hardware was less valuable to the degree that the bitcoin price was reduced.

- And they encouraged premature optimizations like lightning and batching. 

- Opened the door pretty wide for all of the crap coin narratives.

- This may have been a reasonable risk if they thought they could gain control of bitcoin, but they didn't and they couldn't have.
---

# ASIC Boost Attack

- This one may have been profitable. 

- However, this just makes the next attack all the more "Return of the Jedi."

???

- Attackers were able to fake the amount of work they were performing, the amount of electricity they were spending, to secure the network.

- But if this attack did suppress the market price of bitcoin it may not have been profitable. 

- And since it protection of this security flaw the major driver for creating bcash any of those profits were consumed in the next failed attack.

---

# Bitcoin Cash Attack

When it was clear SegWit2x was going to fail Bcash was the fallback attack.

It was a combination of three security flaws spun as features:

- Dangerously large blocks

- Transaction malleability

- Insecure difficulty adjustment

???

- The first two were part of past efforts to get these flaws into bitcoin.

- Difficulty adjustment was just a last minute bonus.

- resulting in miners being able to get rewarded disproportionately to how much they secured the bcash network.

- Primarily targeted the tech illiterate Libertarian community in the US.

- I also suspect investors in non-English speaking countries. 

- Bitmain lost big and is holding 600 Million worth of bcash they can't sell. 

- It is so bad they lied on their IPO balance sheet by inflating the unrealistically high market price of $500 by 400% 

---

# Alt Coin Attacks

- Litecoin 2011
- Ripple 2012

- Monero 2014

- Ethereum 2015

- EOS 2018

- Grin 2019?

???

- If money is a single asset used to facilitate trade then competitors that have no chance of replacing bitcoin are merely attempts to slow adoption of a secure money.

- These really piss me off because so few people in the bitcoin community are willing to call these what they are - scams, frauds and more importantly attacks to slow the adoption of bitcoin and end human slavery and large scale war.

But the two I hate the most are Monero and Grin. They both take advantage of people misunderstanding that the only value of a digital asset is as money and since both of these, for various reasons, can't compete with Bitcoin they are worthless.

- And they are both the most believable so that means they target the smartest people that will fall for them.

- Criminals that run Ponzi schemes rarely get investigated until the end of the ride - no reason to think they have gotten away with it yet.

- Profits are grossly exaggerated

- Profits are not risk adjusted

# Proof of Work Change Attack

Luke Dash Jr. and Cobra mid 2018

- Very loud and coordinated marketing campaign 

- Very prominent and popular contributors to Bitcoin

- Luke has been against previous attacks and written a lot of bitcoin code

- Cobra was given the bitcoin.org domain by Satoshi and endorsed by Adam Back less than a year ago

- Would destroy bitcoins security (possibly irreparably)

???

- We now know this could have saved Bitmain from crushing losses. 

- Would have made bcash the only chain that could be secured with cutting edge hardware.

- Bitmains new SHA256 miners have been failing.

- Follow the money. These guys are not dumb.

- Luke was very greasy about discussing the topic with me.

- I wrote up a systematic breakdown of all of the effects of a proof of work change, posted it to the bitcoin wiki so he and I could discuss one scenario at a time, and he just kept deleting the entire thing. 

- This was after he said he would only discuss it via text.

- Very dishonest about the pros and cons and very sneaky - not the way good guys play ball.

- Watch these guys closely.

---

# Inflation bug found last week

- The bug would have allowed victims to accept bitcoin payments as valid with invalid bitcoin.

- That in and of itself isn't that interesting but it does open us up to a supply cap attack.

???

- It does show that long held bitcoin is more secure than recently held bitcoin. Not just in number of confirmations, but also because bugs like this are in play.

- What if a large number of innocent people are victimized and there is a strong push to honor those new bitcoin?

- Probably just another alt coin, but one that doesn't lack any of the security flaws present in all other alt coins. 

- One that could actually be arguably more secure if the hash power followed.

- One that would legitimately beg the question of the real bitcoin.

- One that might attract more investors as the chain of "reasonable people."

- The solution, imo, is to ensure that the investors have considered this and decide ahead of time that victims will not be made whole.

# Future Attacks
## A sneak peak at next seasons hottest attacks 

---

# Insecure Side Chains 

RSK

- Federated model with bad federation partners

- Obfuscated by requiring 51% of miners to take all the funds.

Drive Chain

- Simply requires 51% of miners to take all the funds.

Liquid 

- Federated model, that could be secure depending on the federation partners are and how much will be stored. 

???

- For the 51% vulnerable second layer networks I plan to help publicly coordinate the "execution of the smart contract" to minimize the amount of damage done.

- Liquid requires collusion from more people, possibly with better reputations, but if the pot is big enough? Its going to have to be carefully managed. It is still custodial.

- RSK and Drive Chain are both created and supported by know bad actors that have intentionally lied in conversations with me so I expect bad things if they get their way.

---

# Bugs in Lightning Network

- The design appears sound

- But it is new so it will have bugs

- They will be exploited if the $ gets big enough

- No single pile of cash

???

- These are just cleverly delayed bitcoin transactions so they are not nearly as risky as custodial side chains.

- But we should expect some losses. Probably minor, but worth anticipating.

# Bitcoin.org will be used to deceive investors
## Cobra strikes again

- Cobra has promoted the bcash attack 

- Cobra has promoted the PoW change attack

- Cobra is a bad guy

- Cobra is the owner of bitcoin.org

???

- If you want to see how greasy this guy is check out the debate that I had with him on my youtube channel.

- The safeguard we need for this is to have a mirrored site and for everyone to cut all links and references to bitcoin.org asap to reduce the damage that will be done.

- As soon as this starts Cobra will probably sell bitcoin.org and possibly to a trustworthy member of the community.


# Large Scale Theft of Private Keys

- Yearly exchange "hacks" will continue

- Side chains are essentially custodial 

- As the value of bitcoin goes and the risks of being caught remain constant we should expect bitcoin theft from custodians.

- Governments may eventually be tempted to steal bitcoin as they did with gold if it remains easily accessible to them.

???

- Custody was the killer security flaw with gold. 

- As long as it is used in bitcoin the pot will oscillate above and below the amount where it is worth stealing.

- In general this also applies to custodial side chain because they are really just a partnership of custodians.
