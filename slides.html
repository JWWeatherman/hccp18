# Smashing Bitcoin for Pain and Losses
## The Bitcoin Threat Model
---

# Today's Grab Bag of Fun

- What threat modeling is and why we should do it

- Why bitcoin matters - the human threat model

- The skeleton of the bitcoin threat model

- A couple fun attacks bitcoin has suffered to date

- What new attacks are on the horizon

- Some great photos of past attackers in compromising positions.

# Everyone is a security design analyst

- Unfortunately almost no one is systematic 

- Bitcoin's first threat model was completed less than 1 year ago

- Every conversation about bitcoin is a threat model brainstorming sessesion

- Threat modeling has been the most popular way to analize design level security since the 1950s

- Very commonly done in all large software companies today

???
Just ask the guys on twitter. 
1. it's not fashionable in academia or pop culture anymore - no one writes or reads treatises
2. As it nears its 10th anniversary.
3. I'd even bet that 80% of the conversations at this conference are threat model brainstorming sessions without the discipline of systematic documentation that would follow.

# Threat Modeling is Systematic Analysis 

Traps our minds in truth 

Exposes our oversights 

Corrects our prejudices

Reveals suprising and profound truth

Accelerates learning

Logic is our most reliable tool to find truth 

???

1. if money must be one thing than alt coins are an attack even if we missed out on 10,000% gains FOREVER

2. If bitcoin is a mission to create a global money ALL alt coins are an attack.


3. If Bcash is an attack then how can Monero, Grin and Litecoin espcape that categorization? 

4. If people are enslaved because it is profitable and bitcoin makes it less profitable it could bring about the end of human slavery - human threat model.

I was not expecting almost anything I found to be true going into the threat modeling exercise.
I certianly didn't expect to find the potential end of human slavery.

5. Many people have accused me of being active in bitcoin before last November beacuse they don't believe I could have learned so much so quickly. It's even worse than that - everything I've learned after the first 6 weeks has not been much more than a footnote. 

6. Logic is required for all thinking. External data is not. If we can find truth through logic it is easier to correct and easier to prove. 2 + 2 = 4 is self evident. It is true "by definition." Systematic analysis emphasises logical thinking.

Logic is far more reliable than history, psychology, instinct, etc. There are many reasons for this, bu the most self evident is that logic can only be wrong from logical errors. Historical analysis can be wrong from logical errors and bad data.

# Why Bitcoin is worth systematic work

Human slavery is recurring has evolved from chattle slavery but retains the fundamental feature of recurring theft (see a bugs life, Directed by John Lasseter). 

Modern forms of human slavery include:
- Socialism
- Taxation
- Prohibition 
- Monopoly
- Legal Tender


Bitcoin has the potential to make them all unprofitable all by itself. 

???
Now it is possible that it will only eliminate legal tender slavery, but that is more than enough to jusfity systematic analysis. And I think it will do much more. But really I think anyone that is considering investing in bitcoin should start with a threat model.

# The bones of the bitcoin threat model

- Bitcoin is a mission to create secure money

- Money is an item used by a group of people that trade together to make trade easier - it is one thing otherwise we don't call it money we call it barter.

- Software Creating, Broadcasting, Confirming, and Observing Transactions

- Humans Operating Nodes and Miners, Investing, Accepting, Coding and Manufacturing Hardware


???

1. Money that can't be easily stolen through inflation, extortion, etc.
2. Read Human Action by Mises.

# Some Noteworthy Attacks
## And the fools that attepmted them
---

# Block Size Increase Attacks

- Bitcoin Unlimited
- Bitcoin XT
- Segwit 2x

Attackers spent significant time and money and reputation on each of these attacks and they all failed to gain the critical mass of suckers required.

# Spam Attacks and Empty Blocks

- 2015 through 2017

Attackers lost millions in mining fees and block rewards.

???

Miners are rewarded with bitcoin, but to the degree the spam attack was successful in slowing bitcoin adoptoin and supressing the price the miners lost money.

They also mined their own garbage transactions instead of transactions with real fee rewards.

And they encouraged premature optimizations such as batching transactions and layer 2 solutions such as lightning network.

And the mining hardware they produce was less valuable to the degree that the bitcoin price was supressed.

This may have been a reasonable risk if they thought they could gain control of bitcoin, but they didn't and they couldn't have.

# ASIC Boost Attack

This one may have been profitable. 

However, this just makes the next attack all the more Return of the Jedi.

???

Attackers were able to fake the amount of work they were performing, the amount of electricity they were spending, to secure the network.

# Bitcoin Cash Attack

When it was clear SegWit2x was going to fail Bcash was the fallback attack.

It was a combination of three security flaws spun as features:

- Dangerously large blocks
- Transaction malability
- Insecure difficulty adjustment

Few investors were decieved. Bitmain lost big and is holding 600 Million worth of bcash they can't sell. It is so bad they lied on their IPO balance sheet by inflating the unrealisticly high market price of $500 by 400% 

This attack was the final blow that turned the largest and most powerful bitcoin company into an empty husk.

???
The first two were part of past efforts to get these flaws into bitcoin, in the case of dangerously large blocks, and keep a fix from being implemented in the case of transaction malability. The third was just a happy bonus thrown into bcash that resulting in miners being able to get rewarded disproportionately to how much they secured the bcash network.

# Alt Coin Attacks

If money is a single asset used to facilitate trade then competitors that have no chance of replacing bitcoin are meerly attempts to slow adoption of a secure money.

- Litecoin 2011
- Ripple 2012
- Ethereum 2015
- EOS 2018
- Monero 2014
- Grin TBD

Profitable for attackers, but profits are grossly exagurated and yet to be realized in most cases.

When risk adjusted for both legal and extra legal justice these attacks may be unprofitable too.

???
These all really piss me off because so few people in the bitcoin community are willing to call these what they are - scams, frauds and more importantly attacks to slow the adoption of bitcoin and end human slavery and large scale war.

But the two I hate the most are Monero and Grin. They both take advantage of people misunderstanding that the only value of a digital asset is as money and since both of these, for various reasons, can't compete with Bitcoin they are worthless.

It's also worth noting that criminals that run ponzi schemes rarely get investigated until the end of the ride when lots of voters are angry they were taken for a ride. I have no reason to think they will get away with these frauds until the value stays near zero for a while and people realize that these were always scams not legitimate projects.

# Proof of Work Change Attack

- Luke Dash Jr and Cobra mid 2018

These guys put on a coordinated effort to convince bitcoin investors that a PoW change would enhance bitcoin's security and harm bitmain. This was obviously false at the time, but with the benefit of hinsight we can see it would have rescued bitmain because their new SHA256 miners have been failing and their bitcoin cash holdings would have become much more valuable as the only digital asset that could be secured with cutting edge hardware.

This could be the end of it, but I expect a renewed effort in 2019.

# Insecure Second Layer Networks

RSK
- Federated model with bad federation partners
- Obvuscated by requiring 51% of miners to take all the funds.

Drive Chain
- Simply requires 51% of miners to take all the funds.

Liquid 
- Federated model, that could be secure depending on the federation partners are and how much will be stored. 

Lightning Network
- The design of Lightning Network appears sound, but it is new so we should expect some attacks if it is adoped for large dollar amounts too early.

For the 51% vulnerable second layer networks I plan to help publicly coordinate the "execution of the smart contract" to minimize the amount of damage done.

# Large Scale Theft of Private Keys

- A large exchange seems to get "hacked" yearly.
- As the value of bitcoin goes and the risks of being caught remain constant we should expect bitcoin theft from custodians.
- Governments may eventually be tempted to steal bitcoin as they did with gold if it remains easily accessable to them.
